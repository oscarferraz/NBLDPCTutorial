Non-binary LDPC Min-max decoder

This repo contains the code for GPU, HLS and RTL for the NB-LDPC min-max decoding algorithm used to obtain the results shown in:

Please cite my work if this code or this papers are useful for you.

I might release a cleaner version of this some time in the future, but probably not, because I'm working on other stuff now.

Good luck!
